  "body": "### Description\r\ngSqlClient is a Python plugin that turns Gedit into a SQL client.\r\nCurrently MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite and SQLServer databases are supported.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nYou will need to install only the drivers you want to use:\r\n\r\n* MySQL:\tMySQLdb, http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/MySQLdb.html\r\n* PostgreSQL:\tPsycopg, http://www.initd.org/psycopg/\r\n* SQLite:\tpysqlite, http://code.google.com/p/pysqlite/\r\n* SQLServer:\tPymssql, http://code.google.com/p/pymssql/\r\n\r\nIt is possible that your Linux distribution has precompiled packages available.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n1. Extract the content of the tarball under $HOME/.gnome2/gedit/plugins/ directory.\r\n2. (Re)start Gedit.\r\n3. Go to Edit->Preferences->Plugins and check the box for gSqlClient.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nCreate a new document and press CTRL+SHIFT+C, you will see the connection dialog. Fill the form and press the \"Connect\" button.\r\nWrite some queries and be sure to separate them by empty lines, put the cursor over one of the queries and\r\npress CTRL+ENTER, you should see a panel with the resultset. If you want to disconnect from the server press CTRL+SHIFT+C\r\nagain and you will see the \"Disconnect\" button.\r\n\r\nThe query separator is an empty line so you don't need a semicolon after the query, this way allows you to have many\r\nqueries on the same document. If you want to execute only part of a query you can select the part you are interested\r\non and press CTRL+ENTER, the plugin will only execute the selection.\r\n\r\nYou can execute the entire document as a script pressing CTRL+SHIFT+R.\r\nWhen pressing CTRL+SHIFT+R for running a script, a new dialog appears with options for handle query errors.\r\n\r\nThere is a contextual menu with options for copy grid values and export resultsets as SQL, XML or CSV\r\nformats, right click on the resultset grid and select the option you want.\r\n\r\nRemember that you can have one different connection on each Gedit tab so you can query different databases from the\r\nsame instance of Gedit.\r\n",
