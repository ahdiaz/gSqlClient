Description
-----------

gSqlClient is a Python plugin that turns Gedit into a SQL client.
Currently MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite and SQLServer databases are supported.

Requirements
------------

You will need to install only the drivers you want to use:

	* MySQL:		MySQLdb, http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/MySQLdb.html
	* PostgreSQL:	Psycopg, http://www.initd.org/psycopg/
	* SQLite:		pysqlite, http://code.google.com/p/pysqlite/
	* SQLServer:	Pymssql, http://code.google.com/p/pymssql/

It is possible that your Linux distribution has precompiled packages available.

Installation
------------

   1. Extract the content of the tarball under $HOME/.gnome2/gedit/plugins/ directory.
   2. (Re)start Gedit.
   3. Go to Edit->Preferences->Plugins and check the box for gSqlClient.

Usage
-----

Create a new document and press CTRL+SHIFT+C, you will see the connection dialog. Fill the form and press the "Connect" button.
Write some queries and be sure to separate them by empty lines, put the cursor over one of the queries and
press CTRL+ENTER, you should see a panel with the resultset. If you want to disconnect from the server press CTRL+SHIFT+C
again and you will see the "Disconnect" button.

The query separator is an empty line so you don't need a semicolon after the query, this way allows you to have many
queries on the same document. If you want to execute only part of a query you can select the part you are interested
on and press CTRL+ENTER, the plugin will only execute the selection.

You can execute the entire document as a script pressing CTRL+SHIFT+R.
When pressing CTRL+SHIFT+R for running a script, a new dialog appears with options for handle query errors.

There is a contextual menu with options for copy grid values and export resultsets as SQL, XML or CSV
formats, right click on the resultset grid and select the option you want.

Remember that you can have one different connection on each Gedit tab so you can query different databases from the
same instance of Gedit.
