Description

gSqlClient is a Python plugin that allows to query MySQL databases from Gedit.
It could be a replacement for the MySQL console (someday).

Installation

   1. Extract the content of the tarball under $HOME/.gnome2/gedit/plugins/ directory.
   2. (Re)start Gedit.
   3. Go to Edit->Preferences->Plugins and check the box for gSqlClient. 

Usage

Create a new document and press CTRL+ALT+C, you will see the connection dialog. Fill the form and press "Connect" button.
Write some queries and be sure to separate them by empty lines, put the cursor over one of the queries and
press CTRL+ENTER, you should see a panel with the resultset. If you want to disconnect from the server press CTRL+ALT+C
again and you will see the "Disconnect" button.

The query separator is an empty line so you don't need a semicolon after the query, this way allows you to have many
queries on the same document. If you want to execute only part of a query you can select the part you are interested
on and press CTRL+ENTER, the plugin will only execute the selection.

Remember that you can have one diferent connection on each Gedit tab so you can query diferent databases from the
same instance of Gedit.
