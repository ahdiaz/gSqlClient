Usage
-----

Create a new document and press CTRL+ALT+C, you will see the connection dialog. Fill the form and press "Connect" button.
Write some queries and be sure to separate them by empty lines, put the cursor over one of the queries and
press CTRL+ENTER, you should see a panel with the resultset. If you want to disconnect from the server press CTRL+ALT+C
again and you will see the "Disconnect" button.

The query separator is an empty line so you don't need a semicolon after the query, this way allows you to have many
queries on the same document. If you want to execute only part of a query you can select the part you are interested
on and press CTRL+ENTER, the plugin will only execute the selection.

You can execute the entire document as a script pressing CTRL+ALT+R.
When pressing CTRL+ALT+R for running a script, a new dialog appears with options for handle query errors.

There is a contextual menu with options for copy grid values and export resultsets as XML or CSV
formats, right click on the resultset grid and select the option you want.

Remember that you can have one diferent connection on each Gedit tab so you can query diferent databases from the
same instance of Gedit.
